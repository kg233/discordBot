two types of invokes: stateless and stateful

stateless invokes always return the same thing when triggered

stateful keeps track of the current state of the invocation. When user invokes the same command to proceed, stateful invokes will check and do appropriate updates.

stateful invokes can be saved, either saving info or something (TBD)
  need to be able to continue with/without creating a new invoke object
